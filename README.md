# LiveBusTracker

Functional requirements
• As a User I want to be able to view the live Bus
• As a User I want to be alert when the bus is near my stop
• As an Admin I want to be able to view/edit/add/delete buses
• As an Admin I want to be able to view/edit/add/delete bus routes
Application target audience
The application is aimed at anyone who regularly uses public transport to locate the bus they want 
to catch. As google maps doesn’t provide that feature. There is also no application (to my 
knowledge) that alerts when a bus is due at a specific stop.
